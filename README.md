## Full Stack Frameworks With Djagno Project - Milestone Project 4
The purpose of this project, is to build a full-stack site. I have chosen to rebuild my businesses website [SanitizeUk](www.sanitizetheuk.com) right now it is a basic godaddy website and I would like to build a better more robust site that allowas users to log in view previous orders make purchases and also book a consultation.
